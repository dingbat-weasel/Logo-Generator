## Description

This CLI will produce an SVG file consisting of a basic shape, either a triangle, circle, or square, that contains a three letter string. Primarily developed for personal practice, I learned more about developing CLI's using the inquirer npm package, as well as simple SVG development. In addition there are tests using jest.

## Usage

To use this application navigate into the main directory and run 'npm install'. Once the packages are installed you can run 'node index.js' to run the application. Follow the prompts and an svg file will be written to the './output' directory.

This application depends on inquirer and jest.

## Tests

Tests can be run using the 'npm run test' command.
